## Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are a class of algorithms inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers. Neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns in data and are widely used in various machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network architecture particularly suited for image recognition and computer vision tasks. CNNs are characterized by their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of image data through the use of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Diffusion Models

Diffusion Models are a recent advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP). They are generative models designed to generate coherent text by iteratively denoising noise-corrupted versions of input text sequences. Diffusion Models leverage the transformer architecture and offer state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks.
